This is a hackathon project to learn more about SSTables and LSM-Trees which is
the storage engine powering many key value based storage engines like RocksDB and
LevelDB.

Designing Data-Intensive Applications chapter 3 (Storage and Retrieval) has a really good overview of the overall
structure I am trying to achieve here. 

The main goal here is to learn more about database engines by doing!

A very rudimentary benchmark / test can be run with `python simple_bench.py`
